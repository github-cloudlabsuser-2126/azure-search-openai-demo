# Backend App Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the backend app structure and functionality.

## File Structure

The backend app has the following file structure:

```
app
└── backend
    ├── src
    │   ├── controllers
    │   │   └── index.js
    │   ├── models
    │   │   └── index.js
    │   └── routes
    │       └── index.js
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md
```

- `src/controllers/index.js`: This file exports a class `IndexController` which has a method `getIndex` that handles the root route of the application.
- `src/models/index.js`: This file exports a class `IndexModel` which represents the data model for the application.
- `src/routes/index.js`: This file exports a function `setRoutes` which sets up the routes for the application. It uses the `IndexController` to handle the root route.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- `README.md`: This file contains the generated markdown documentation for the backend app.

## Functionality

The backend app provides the following functionality:

- The root route of the application is handled by the `IndexController` class in `src/controllers/index.js`. The `getIndex` method is responsible for handling the request and returning the response.
- The data model for the application is defined by the `IndexModel` class in `src/models/index.js`. It represents the structure and behavior of the data used by the backend app.
- The routes for the application are set up by the `setRoutes` function in `src/routes/index.js`. It uses the `IndexController` to handle the root route.
